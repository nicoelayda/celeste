      Celeste is a lightweight theme that features a minimalist, content-first 
      design.
    </p>
    <p>
      It places your content center stage and lets your readers view them in a 
      clutter-free environment without visual distractions. Celeste is 
      mobile-first and works beautifully on all devices.
